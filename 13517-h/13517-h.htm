    <p><i>The few introductory words to this volume were written,
    and the last proofs posted, shortly before the fatal news
    overtook me in lovely Venice. My world, resplendent with
    sunshine, was suddenly lost in darkness. The most lovable of
    men, whose presence alone sufficed to make life worth living to
    all those near and dear to him, was gone from amongst us. His
    hand was no longer to hold those pens&mdash;the finely-pointed
    one that drew, the freely-flowing one that wrote. His
    well-earned rest was not to be enjoyed on earth.</i></p>

    <p><i>Now that all is changed, the joyous note of these pages
    jars upon me. How differently would I attune the story of our
    student days, were I to write it to-day in loving memory of my
    friend!</i></p>

    <p><i>But as it stands, so it must go forth. The book,
    cordially endorsed by him, is printed and all but issued; he
    would not let me recall it, I know. He himself, in his kindly,
    simple way, had enjoyed my resuscitation of our early
    recollections, and had here and there lent a helpful hand even
    to the correcting of the
    proofs.</i></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"

    <h1>IN BOHEMIA WITH DU MAURIER</h1>

    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>

    <p>"You'll see that I've used up all your Mesmerism and a
    trifle more in my new book," said du Maurier to me, some time
    before he published his "Trilby"; and that remark started us
    talking of the good old times in Antwerp, and overhauling the
    numerous drawings and sketches in which he so vividly depicted
    the incidents of our Bohemian days. It seemed to me that some
    of those drawings should be published, if only to show how my
    now so popular friend commenced his artistic career. In order
    that they should not go forth without explanation, I wrote the
    following pages.</p>

    <p>The Bohemia I have sought to coerce into book shape, is not
    the wild country, peopled by the delightfully unconventional
    savages, so often described, but a little cultivated corner of
    the land, as I found it in Antwerp, a mere background to the
    incidents I had to relate. Such
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>{10}</span> as it is, it may perhaps serve
       here and there to point to the original soil from which were
       eventually to spring some of the figures so familiar to us
       to-day.</p>

    <p>To me it was a source of enjoyment to evoke these memories,
    and if I publish them, it is because I strongly feel that
    pleasures shared are pleasures doubled. Sociably inclined as I
    always was, I am truly glad to have the opportunity of giving a
    hearty welcome to those who may care to join my friend and
    myself in our ramblings and our "tumblings."</p>

    <h2>I.</h2>

    <h2>"TUMBLINGS"</h2>

    <h3><i>WITH DU MAURIER AND FRIENDS.</i></h3>

    <p>"I well remember" my first meeting with du Maurier in the
    class-rooms of the famous Antwerp Academy.</p>

    <p>I was painting and blagueing, as one paints and blagues in
    the storm and stress period of one's artistic development.</p>

    <p>It had been my good fortune to commence my studies in Paris;
    it was there, in the atelier Gleyre, I had cultivated, I think
    I may say, very successfully, the essentially French art of
    chaffing, known by the name of "La blague parisienne," and I
    now was able to give my less lively Flemish friends and
    fellow-students the full benefit of my experience. Many
    pleasant recollections bound me to Paris; so, when I heard one
    day that a "Nouveau" had arrived, straight from my old
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>{18}</span> atelier Gleyre, I was not a
       little impatient to make his acquaintance.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/17.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/17.png"
             alt="THE ATELIER GLEYRE." /></a>THE ATELIER GLEYRE.
    </div>

    <p>The new-comer was du Maurier. I sought him out, and, taking
    it for granted that he was a Frenchman, I addressed him in
    French; we were soon engaged in lively conversation, asking and
    answering questions about the comrades in Paris, and sorting
    the threads that associated us both with the same place. "Did
    you know 'un nommé Pointer'?" he asked, exquisitely
    Frenchy-fying the name for my benefit. I mentally translated
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>{19}</span> this into equally exquisite
       English, my version naturally being: "A man called
       Poynter."</p>

    <p>Later on an American came up, with whom I exchanged a few
    words in his and my native tongue. "What the D. are
    you&mdash;English?" broke in du Maurier. "And what the D. are
    you?" I rejoined. I forget whether D. stood for Dickens or for
    the other one; probably it was the latter. At any rate, whether
    more or less emphatic in our utterances, we then and there made
    friends on a sound international basis.</p>

    <p>It seemed to me that at this our first meeting du Maurier
    took me in at a glance&mdash;the eager, hungry glance of the
    caricaturist. He seemed struck with my appearance, as well he
    might be. I wore a workman's blouse that had gradually taken
    its colour from its surroundings. To protect myself from the
    indiscretions of my comrades I had painted various warnings on
    my back, as, for instance, "Bill stickers beware," "It is
    forbidden to shoot rubbish here," and the like. My very black
    hair, ever inclined to run riot, was encircled by a craftily
    conceived band of crochet-work, such as only a fond mother's
    hand could devise, and I was doubtless colouring some
    meerschaum of eccentric design. My
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>{20}</span> fellow-student, the now famous
       Matthew Maris, immortalised that blouse and that piece of
       crochet-work in the admirable oil-sketch here
       reproduced.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/19.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/19.png"
             alt="MY BLOUSE." /></a>MY BLOUSE.<br />
         (<i>From an oil-sketch by Matthew Maris.</i>)
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>{21}</span> 

    <p>It has always been a source of legitimate pride to me to
    think that I should have been the tool selected by Providence
    to sharpen du Maurier's pencil; there must have been something
    in my "Verfluchte Physiognomie," as a very handsome young
    German, whom I used to chaff unmercifully, called it, to reveal
    to du Maurier hidden possibilities and to awaken in him those
    dormant capacities which had betrayed themselves in the eager
    glance above named.</p>

    <p>This was, I believe, in 1857; not feeling over sure as
    regards that date, I refer to a bundle of du Maurier's letters
    before me, but they offer me no assistance; there is but one
    dated, and that one merely headed: "Dusseldorf, 19th Cent."
    Well, in 1857, then, let us take it, the Antwerp Academy was
    under the direction of De Keyser, that most urbane of men and
    painters. Van Lerius, well known to many American and English
    lovers of art, her Majesty included, was professor of the
    Painting Class, and amongst the students there were many who
    rapidly made themselves a name, as Tadema, M. Maris, Neuhuys,
    Heyermans, and the armless artist, whose foot-painted copies
    after the Masters at the Antwerp Gallery are well known to
    every <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>{22}</span> tourist. The teaching was of a
       sound, practical nature, strongly imbued with the tendencies
       of the colourist school. Antwerp ever sought to uphold the
       traditions of a great Past; in the atelier Gleyre you might
       have studied form and learnt to fill it with colour, but
       here you would be taught to manipulate colour, and to limit
       it by form. A peculiar kind of artistic kicks and cuffs were
       administered to the student by Van Lerius as he went his
       rounds. "That is a charming bit of colour you have painted
       in that forehead," he said to me on one occasion&mdash;"so
       delicate and refined. Do it again," he added, as he took up
       my palette knife and scraped off the "delicate bit." "Ah,
       you see, <i>savez vous</i>, you can't do it again; you got
       it by fluke, some stray tints off your palette, <i>savez
       vous</i>," and, taking the biggest brush I had, he swept
       over that palette and produced enough of the desired tints
       to have covered a dozen foreheads.</p>

    <p>The comrade without arms was a most assiduous worker; it was
    amusing to watch his mittened feet step out of their shoes and
    at the shortest notice proceed to do duty as hands; his nimble
    toes would screw and unscrew the tops of the colour tubes or
    handle the brush as steadily
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>{23}</span> as the best and deftest of
       fingers could have done. Very much unlike any of us, he was
       most punctilious in the care he bestowed on his paint box,
       as also on his personal appearance. Maris, Neuhuys,
       Heyermans, and one or two others equally gifted, but whose
       thread of life was soon to be cut short, were painting
       splendid studies, some of which I was fortunate enough to
       rescue from destruction and have happily preserved.</p>

    <p>Quite worthy to be placed next to these are
    Van-der-something's studies. That (or something like that) was
    the name of a wiry, active little man who in those days painted
    in a garret; there everything was disarranged chaotically,
    mostly on the floor, for there was no furniture that I can
    recollect beyond a stool, an easel, and a fine old
    looking-glass. He had a house, though, and a wife, in marked
    contrast with his appearance and the garret. The house was not
    badly appointed, and she was lavishly endowed with an
    exuberance of charms and graces characteristic of a Rubens
    model.</p>

    <p>A fellow-student of mine was their lodger, a handsome young
    German, brimful of talent, but sadly deficient in health. He
    had always held <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>{24}</span> most rigid principles on
       questions of morality, but unfortunately they failed one day
       in their application, owing to the less settled views
       entertained by Madame Van-der-something on such subjects.
       She certainly gave him much affection on the one hand, but
       on the other she so audaciously appropriated those of his
       goods and chattels that could be turned into money, that the
       police had to intervene, and she eventually found herself
       before a judge and jury. There, however, she managed so well
       to cast all responsibility on her husband, who, to this day,
       I believe was quite innocent, that&mdash;"cherchez la
       femme"&mdash;she got off, and he was sentenced to a term of
       imprisonment.</p>

    <p>Now if Van Ostade or Teniers had risen to prosecute him for
    forging their signatures, and he had been found guilty and
    condemned to severe punishment, it would have served him right.
    He was a perfect gem of a forger. He picked up a stock of those
    dirty old pictures painted on worm-eaten panels that used to
    abound in the sale-rooms of Antwerp. On these he would paint
    what might be called replicas with variations, cribbing left
    and right from old mildewed prints that were scattered all
    about the floor. He would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>{25}</span> scrape and scumble, brighten and
       deaden with oils and varnishes; he would dodge and
       manipulate till his picture, after a given time spent in a
       damp cellar, would emerge as a genuine old master. I once
       asked a dealer whom I knew to be a regular customer of his,
       at what price he sold one of those productions. "I really
       can't say," he answered; "I only do wholesale business. I
       buy for exportation to England and America." If any of my
       friends here or over there possess some work of
       Van-der-something's, I sincerely congratulate them, for the
       little man was a genius in his way.</p>

    <p>Of my friend the German I have only to say that, poor
    fellow, he spent but a short life of pleasure and of pain. What
    became of his Circe I never sought to know. It was a clear case
    of "Ne cherchez pas la femme!"</p>

    <p>The first friend I made on my arrival in Antwerp was Jean
    Heyermans (detto il Pegghi), and a very useful one he proved
    himself, for he at once took me in hand, helped me to find home
    and hearth, and generally gave me the correct tip, so valuable
    to the stranger. He lost no time in teaching me some of those
    full-flavoured Flemish idioms which from the first enabled me
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>{26}</span> to emphasise my meaning when I
       wished to express it in unmistakable language.</p>

    <p>He himself was a remarkable linguist, speaking English,
    French, and German fluently, in addition to his native
    language, Dutch; so he soon chummed with du Maurier and me in
    several languages, and became one of our set. He was always
    ready to follow us in our digressions from the conventional
    course, and we felt that many of our best international jokes
    would have been lost had it not been for his comprehension and
    appreciation. His father, too, was a kind friend to us,
    inviting us to his house to hear Music and talk Art, to ply
    knives and forks, and to empty glasses of various dimensions.
    That gentleman's corpulence had reached a degree which clearly
    showed that he must have "lost sight of his knees" some years
    back, but he was none the less strong and active. There were
    two daughters, one pathetically blind, the other
    sympathetically musical.</p>

    <p>How our friend came by the name of Peggy none of us know,
    but he figures as such in many of du Maurier's drawings.</p>

    <p>"If Peggy," he says, in a letter from Malines, "doesn't come
    on Sunday, may the vengeance of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>{27}</span> the gods overtake him! Tell him
       so. I'll meet him at the train." And then he sketches the
       meeting and greeting of the two, and the railway guard
       starting his train with the old-fashioned horn-signal on the
       G.E.C. then in use.</p>

    <p>My friend Jean soon started on his career as a regular
    exhibitor in Belgium and Holland, besides which he developed a
    remarkable taste and talent for teaching.</p>

    <p>"What would you advise about Pen's studies?" said Robert
    Browning one afternoon as we sat in my little studio, talking
    about his son's talents and prospects. (This was a few years
    after my final return to England.) "Send him to Antwerp," I
    said, "to Heyermans; he is the best man I know of to start
    him."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>{28}</span> 

    <p>Pen went, and soon made surprising progress, painting a
    picture after little more than a twelve-month that at once
    found an eager purchaser. The poet took great pride in his
    son's success, and lost no opportunity of speaking in the most
    grateful and appreciative terms of the teacher. Millais and
    Tadema endorsed his praise, and Heyermans' reputation was
    established. A few years ago he migrated to London, where he
    continues his work, pluckily upholding the traditions of the
    Past, whilst readily encouraging the wholesome aspirations of a
    rising generation.</p>

    <p>Another man destined to find a permanent home in England was
    Alma Tadema. He was not much in the Painting Class in my time,
    but had previously been hard at work there. I mostly saw him in
    the room adjoining it, and he always seemed to me exclusively
    interested in the study of costume and history. The incident
    that led to his leaving the academy rather abruptly is
    characteristic. An uncle of his having given him a commission
    for a picture, Tadema applied to de Keyser for authorisation to
    make the necessary break in his studies. The Director accorded
    him three weeks, but, as Tadema put it when lately recalling
    the circumstance, "I couldn't
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>{29}</span> paint a picture in three weeks
       then, and I cannot now."</p>

    <p>I little thought that from his studies of costume and
    history, the comrade of my Antwerp days would evolve a long and
    uninterrupted series of masterpieces, resuscitating the Past
    and presenting it with the erudition of the Student and the
    genius of the Artist. Nor did anything foreshadow that my
    genial Dutch friend, to whom the English language was a dead
    letter, was destined in a not too distant Future to become a
    shining light of England's Royal Academy.</p>

    <p>Du Maurier was soon installed in the Painting Class, and
    made a vigorous start. Of the things he painted, I particularly
    recollect a life-size, three-quarter group of an old woman and
    a boy&mdash;a pen-and-ink drawing of which is in my father's
    album&mdash;that showed talent enough and to spare, but his
    artistic aspirations were soon to meet with a serious check.
    His eyesight suddenly gave him trouble, and before long put a
    stop to his studies at atelier or academy. He was not to become
    a painter, as he had fondly hoped, but as we now know, he was
    to work out his destiny in another direction. With the simplest
    of means he was to delineate character, and everyday drops of
    ink, when filtered through his pen, were to emerge in quaint or
    graceful shapes, wit, satire, and sentiment taking their turns
    to prompt and guide that
    pen.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"

    <p>In those days we called all that caricaturing, and
    caricature he certainly did; mainly me and himself. From the
    first he imagined he saw a marked contrast between us. His nose
    was supposed to be turned up, and mine down, whereas really
    neither his nor mine much deviated from the ordinary run of
    noses; my lower lip certainly does project, but his does not
    particularly recede, and so on. But the imaginary contrast
    inspired him in the earliest days of our acquaintance, and
    started him on the warpath of pen-and-inking. He drew us in all
    conceivable and in some inconceivable situations. "Moscheles
    and I," he says on one page, "had we not been artists, or had
    we been artistically beautiful; then again, if we were of the
    fair sex, or soldiers, or, by way of showing our versatility,
    if we were horses." In that page he seems to have focussed the
    essence of our characteristics, whilst appearing only to
    delineate our human and equine possibilities. Poor F.,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>{32}</span> one of our German friends, fares
       badly, a donkey's head portraying him "s'il était

    <p>In consequence of the growing trouble with his eyes, du

    <p>In those days railway travelling was not as rapid as it is
    now, but one could get from Antwerp to Malines in about an
    hour, a circumstance which I frequently turned to account. Du
    Maurier's mother had come to live with him, his sister joining
    them for a short time, and the home in quiet old Malines soon
    became a sort <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>{35}</span> of haven of rest. I spent many a
       happy day and night there, on which occasions I am bound to
       say that the piano, requisitioned by me for some special
       purposes of musical caricature, detracted somewhat from the
       restfulness of the haven. However that may have been, such
       intrusion was never resented; my Swedish prima donna, or my
       qualifications as a basso profondo, or a brass-bandsman,
       were always treated with the greatest indulgence by the
       ladies, and my high soprano flourished and
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>{36}</span> positively reached unknown
       altitudes under the beneficent sunshine of their applause.

    <p>Then du Maurier would sing the French "romance" or the
    English song, or he would "dire la chansonnette," and what with
    his sympathetic tenor and his intuitive knowledge of music, he
    seemed to be able to express more than many who had had the
    advantage of a musical training. A few old letters of his
    remind me that we were audacious enough to write verses and
    music, he doing the former, I the latter.</p>

    <p>"Here's something I particularly want you to do," he writes.
    "Take strong coffee, inspire yourself, think of your 'Ideal,'
    and compose some very pretty music to the enclosed words, with
    which Rag's ideal flame has inspired Rag&mdash;<i>surtout</i>,
    let it be as good as possible, with accompaniment <i>à
    l'avenant</i>. An alteration in the music of each stanza would
    render the gradation of energy expressed in the words, 'Je
    compte sur toi.'" (How du Maurier came by the name of "Rag" I
    must tell later on.) <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"

       "Moscheles or Mephistopheles, which?" he asks, as he depicts
       me at the piano, perhaps evolving some such accompaniment
       from the depths of "untrained inner consciousness." "Eureka"
       he might have put under that other sketch, where his own
       hands have at last found some long-sought harmony or chord

       from my ever-puffing cigar, whilst at my feet is stretched
       the meditative form of my friend, and under them is crushed
       some work of our immortal colleague Beethoven.</p>

    <p>And who was "She" thus to inspire us? On the supposition
    that most people are, like myself, interested in the "Shes"
    that can inspire, I may permit myself to say something about
    the attractive young lady who was able to lead us by easy

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"

    <p>The truth of the matter is that we shared fraternally in the
    enjoyment of her good graces, he having the pull of me the
    greater part of the week, and only suspending operations in my
    favour when I came to Malines on a Saturday to Monday visit.
    These occasions were productive of a great number of drawings
    and sketches, illustrating our little adventures, and all
    plainly showing that the incidents recorded occurred to us at
    that pleasant time of life, when bright illusions and buoyant
    spirits lead the way, and when sorrow itself has more of the
    rose colour than many a rose of a later day.</p>

    <p>Malines was, and perhaps is still, a dull, deserted city, at
    best up to the date of last century, beating the record for
    dry-as-dustiness and growing dear little blades of grass
    between its cobble stones. It boasts of a great many churches
    and of a very great many more priests. (<i>Vide</i>: The
    ingenious use which Rag makes of Bobtail's pliable hat.) In
    addition to these attractions, there was, however, a factor of
    paramount interest to us. Then and there, just as now and
    elsewhere, there were pretty girls about,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>{46}</span> and I need not say that, as both
       of us were studying art and devoting our best energies to
       the cult of the beautiful, we considered it our duty to take
       special notice of these pretty girls wherever we came across
       them. It is probably the conscientious performance of his
       duty in that direction which enabled du Maurier to evolve
       those ever-attractive and sympathetic types of female beauty
       we are all so familiar with. Nor would it have been becoming
       in me, who had everything to learn, to lag behind, or to
       show less ardour in the pursuit of my studies.</p>

    <p>Thus, whilst du Maurier's facile pen was throwing off black
    and white sketches of Miss
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>{47}</span> Carry, it was reserved for me to
       paint her portrait in oils. Her real name was Octavie, not
       Carry; that appellation we had most unceremoniously and
       unpoetically derived from "Cigar." All else about her we
       invested, if not with ceremony with a full amount of poetry.
       And certainly there was a subtle quality in Carry, well
       worthy of appreciation, a faculty of charming and being
       charmed, of giving and taking, of free and easiness, coupled
       with ladylike reserve. She seemed to be born with the
       intuitive knowledge that there was only one life worth
       living, that of the Bohemian, and to be at the same time
       well protected by a pretty reluctance to admit as much. In
       fact, to give a correct idea of her I need but say her soul
       was steeped in the very essence of Trilbyism. Having got to
       Carry's soul, it may not be inappropriate to say something
       also about her looks; but to describe good looks is, as we
       all know, deliberately to court failure; far better request
       every man to conjure up his own type of beauty and he will
       be sure to be interested in the picture he evolves. That man
       will be nearest the truth whose young lady has a rich crop
       of brown curly hair, very blue inquisitive eyes, and a
       figure of peculiar
       elasticity.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>{48}</span> 

    <p>Octavie L., dite Carry, was the daughter of an organist who
    had held a good position at one of the principal churches of
    Malines. When he died he left but a small inheritance to his
    widow; with what she could realise, she purchased the goodwill
    of a small tobacconist's store and set up in business. Neither
    the mother nor the daughter had much previous knowledge of the
    concern they had started, and they were consequently not very
    discriminating in the selection of their brands; but what was
    lacking in connoisseurship was fully made up for by Mrs. L.'s
    obliging manners and by Octavie's blue eyes. These had been
    steadily gaining in expression since she first opened them
    about seventeen years back. Customers soon came in, and for a
    time the little business was as flourishing as anything could
    well be in Malines. The average citizen of so ecclesiastically
    conservative, and hereditarily stationary a city could hardly
    be expected to encourage a new venture of the kind. Still even
    there there were some young men about town, a sort of "jeunesse
    doré", not of 18-carat gold perhaps, but a "jeunesse" quite
    equal to the pleasant task of buzzing around the fair
    tobacconist. Mrs. L. did her share of chaperoning; du Maurier
    and I supplied the rest, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>{49}</span> and watched over her with
       chivalrous, if not quite disinterested devotion. We differed
       in every respect from the type of the young man of the
       period above mentioned; so naturally we were bright stars in
       Carry's firmament; she looked upon us as superior beings,
       and, granting her points of comparison, not without cause;
       du Maurier could draw and I could paint; he could sing and I
       could mesmerise, and couldn't we just both talk beautifully!
       We neither of us encourage hero-worship now, but then we
       were "bons princes," and graciously accepted Carry's homage
       as due to our superior merits.</p>

       id="page51"></a>{51}</span> 

    <p>Mesmerism, or, as the fashion of to-day calls it, Hypnotism,
    formed so frequent a topic of conversation and speculation
    between du Maurier and myself, that it takes a very prominent
    place in my recollections.</p>

    <p>In Paris I had had opportunities of attending some most
    interesting séances, in consequence of which I soon proceeded
    to investigate the mesmeric phenomena on my own account. Now I
    have not touched the fluid for some thirty years; I swore off
    because it was taking too much out of me; but I look back with
    pleasure on my earlier experiments, successes I may say, for I
    was fortunate enough to come across several exceptional
    subjects. Du Maurier was particularly interested in one of
    these, Virginie Marsaudon, and had a way of putting puzzling
    questions concerning her faculties and my mesmeric influence.
    Virginie was a "femme de ménage" of the true Parisian type, a
    devoted elderly creature, a sort of cross between a charwoman
    and a housekeeper. I was not yet eighteen when I first went to
    Paris, to study under my cousin, the eminent painter, Henri
    Lehmann. At his studio I found Virginie installed as the
    presiding genius of the establishment, using in turn broom or
    tub, needle, grill or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>{52}</span> frying-pan as the occasion might
       require; the wide range of her powers I further extended by
       making a truly remarkable mesmeric subject of her. My début
       in Paris was that of the somewhat bewildered foreigner,
       speaking but very indifferent French, and she had from the
       first done what she could to make me feel at home in the
       strange city, treating me with truly motherly care and
       devotion. How completely she took possession of me, is shown
       by a passage in a letter she wrote when I was ill in
       Leipsic, where I had gone on a visit to my parents. After
       expressing her anxiety and her regret at not being there to
       nurse me, she emphatically says:&mdash;"Je rends Madame,
       votre mère, responsable de votre santé" (I make Madame, your
       mother, responsible for your health). It needed but little
       to lead her on from a state of docile and genial dependence
       to one of unconscious mesmeric subjection, and so, a few
       passes shaping her course, I willed her across the boundary
       line that separates us from the unknown, a line which,
       thanks to science, is daily being extended. Madame veuve
       Marsaudon was herself an incorrigible disbeliever in the
       phenomena of mesmerism, but as a subject her faculties were
       such as to surprise and convert many a
       scoffer.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>{53}</span> 

    <p>At the séances, to which I invited my friends and a few
    scientific outsiders, I always courted the fullest
    investigation, taking it as the first duty of the mesmerist to
    show cause why he should not be put down as a charlatan. So we
    had tests and counter-tests, evidence and counter-evidence;
    there were doctors to feel the pulse and to scrutinise the
    rigidity of the muscles, experts to propound scientific ifs and
    buts, and wiseacres generally to put spokes in the wheel of
    progress, as is their playful way, wherever they find that
    wheel in motion. It was doubly satisfactory, then, that the
    good faith of subject and mesmerist could be conclusively
    proved.</p>

    <p>One of these séances led to a rather amusing incident. One
    night I was awakened from first slumbers by a sharp ring at my
    bell, and when, after some parleying, I opened the door, I
    found myself confronted by two individuals. One I recognised as
    an "inquirer" who had been brought to my rooms some time
    previously; the other was a lad I had not seen before. The
    inquirer, I ascertained, having carefully watched my <i>modus
    operandi</i> on the occasion of his visit, had next tried
    experiments of his own. In this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>{54}</span> instance he had succeeded in
       mesmerising a lad, but had found it impossible to recall him
       to his normal condition. So, securing him by a leather strap
       fastened round his waist, he led him through the streets of
       Paris to my rooms. There we both tried our powers upon him,
       the result being very unsatisfactory. The youth, feeling
       himself freed from one operator and not subjected by the
       other, refused allegiance to either, and, being of a
       pugnacious temperament, he squared up and commenced striking
       out at both of us. It was not without considerable
       difficulty that I re-mesmerised him completely, and then,
       having previously prepared his mind to account naturally for
       his presence in my rooms, I succeeded in awakening him, and
       all ended happily. The inquirer was duly grateful, the youth
       went home strapless and none the worse for the adventure,
       and I proceeded to do some very sound sleeping on my own
       account.</p>

    <p>I would say more of my séances and all the recollections
    they evoke, were I not impatient to get back to du Maurier and
    to Malines. Once on the experiences of those days, I have much
    to relate&mdash;pros and cons, if you please, for that subtle
    magnetic fluid, which, without physical
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>{55}</span> contact, one human being can
       transmit to another, is a ticklish one to handle. I cannot
       pack my pen, though, and take train of thought to the
       Belgian city without mentioning my friend Allongé, the
       well-known French artist, then a fellow-student of mine at
       the Ecole des Beaux Arts. A chance contact of our knees as
       we sat closely packed with some sixty other students put me
       on the track of a new subject, perhaps the most interesting
       one it was ever my good fortune to come across. But of him
       another time.</p>

    <p>Using the privilege of a mesmerist, I elect to will the
    reader&mdash;that is, if natural slumber has not ere this put
    him beyond my control&mdash;across the frontier, into the back
    parlour of Mrs. L.'s tobacco store. There I am operating on a
    boy&mdash;such a stupid little Flemish boy that no amount of
    fluid could ever make him clever. How I came to treat him to
    passes I don't remember; probably I used him as an
    object-lesson to amuse Carry. All I recollect is that I gave
    him a key to hold, and made him believe that it was red-hot and
    burnt his fingers, or that it was a piece of pudding to be
    eaten presently, thereby making him howl and grin
    alternately.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>{56}</span> 

    <p>In the middle of our séance Carry is called away by a
    customer, one of the swells of Malines much addicted to a
    poetical expression of his admiration for the fair sex in
    general and for Carry in particular. Greatly to our
    edification, she was pleased to improve the occasion by leading
    him on, within our hearing, to make what is commonly called a
    fool of himself. The pleasant incident is recorded in the
    accompanying sketch.</p>

    <p>But mesmerism meant more than incidental amusement or even
    scientific experiment to us in those Antwerp and Malines days.
    When one stands on the threshold of a world of mysteries one
    cannot but long to bridge over the chasm that separates one
    from the gods, the fairies, or the fiends. To be sure, we
    should have been glad if we could have got "light, more light"
    thrown on our steps, but, failing that, we tried to find our
    way as best we could in the mist. We loved that
    never-attainable Will-o'-the-Wisp, "Truth," for its own dear
    Bohemian sake; so, guided by Fancy and Fantasy, we made
    frequent inroads into the boundless land where unknown forces
    pick up our poor dear little conception of the Impossible,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>{57}</span> and use it as the starting-point
       of never-to-be-exhausted possibilities.</p>

    <p>Such a land was particularly well suited to the state of our
    outward-bound minds and our excelsior appetites. It was on one
    or the other of these excursions, I feel confident, that du
    Maurier was inoculated with the germs that were eventually to
    develop into Trilbyism and Svengalism. No wonder, then, if in
    more than one of his letters and sketches the future delineator
    of those characters embodies bold dreams and fancies, or if on
    one occasion he depicts himself, with fixed gaze and hair
    erect, sitting bolt upright on my hospitable sofa, thrilled and
    overawed by the midnight presence of the uncanny, which I had
    evoked for his benefit.</p>

    <p>"Yes, governor, it's all very well to ask a nervous fellow
    to Antwerp and amuse him and make him ever so jolly and
    comfortable&mdash;But why, when the bleak November wind sobs

    <p>My rooms in Antwerp were the scene of many a festive
    gathering. We always spoke of them in the plural; it sounded
    better, but in reality there was only one room with two small
    alcoves. Studies and sketches covered the walls or littered the
    floor, and the genial figure of a skeleton, in very perfect
    condition, stood in the corner by the piano. At first it came
    with a view to instructing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>{61}</span> me in the Science of Anatomy,
       but soon, putting aside any didactic pretensions, my bony
       professor became quite a companion and friend; it was thus
       natural that on those occasions when guests had been
       convened to my rooms, he would take a leading part,
       generally appearing gracefully draped and appropriately
       illuminated, and thus forming a fitting background to the
       gay proceedings of the evening. We had music, recitation,
       and acting, mostly of an improvised, homemade character. The
       sounds thereof were not confined, however, to the narrow
       limits of home, but spread far beyond it, a fact which the
       neighbours, I am sure, would have been at any time ready
       most emphatically to attest.</p>

    <p>In justice to myself I may say that I was primarily
    answerable for the magnitude of the sound waves, but I am bound
    to add that my example was followed and even improved upon by
    the more lung-gifted of my companions. Amongst the milder forms
    of entertainment was my impersonation of Rachel. That grand
    actress I had often seen in Paris, and had, more than once,
    shivered in my shoes as she annihilated the Tyrant, pouring
    forth the vials of her wrath and indignation in the classical
    language of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
       id="page62"></a>{62}</span> Racine and Corneille. With those
       accents still ringing in my ears I came to Antwerp, and
       there, when surrounded by sympathetic friends, the spirit
       would sometimes move me, and I would feel&mdash;excuse the
       conceit of youth&mdash;as if I too could have been a great
       female Tragedian, had Fate not otherwise disposed of me. In
       such moments I would seize the blade of the paper-knife, and
       use the blood of the beet-root, drape myself in the
       classical folds of the bed-sheet, and go for the Tyrant,
       hissing fearful hexameters of scorn and vituperation into
       his ears, and usually winding up with a pose so
       magnificently triumphant that it would bring down any house
       which was not of the most solid construction.</p>

    <p>Another time the cushion yonder would be my child&mdash;the
    orthodox long-lost one&mdash;"It is!&mdash;It is not!&mdash;It
    is!&mdash;Let me clasp it to my other cushion!" "Toi mon fils
    chéri. Ange de mon enfer, douleur de mes
    loisirs!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"

    </div>

    <p>The celebration of one of my birthdays was an event rescued
    from oblivion by du Maurier's pencil. He illustrates our lively
    doings on that day and my appearance the next morning. "Felix's
    mamma," he says, "had worked a very
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>{65}</span> pretty cap for Felix, and Felix
       had it on the morning after his birthday, and Felix found
       that though the cap was very pretty, it made him look very
       seedy."</p>

    <p>In the other drawing he gives striking likenesses of the
    friends assembled to celebrate the festive occasion. They had
    come together in the evening, much in the same spirit that had
    led them under my windows in the morning, with a brass band and
    an enormous bouquet of cabbages, carrots, and cauliflowers.
    There, on the left, is Van Lerius with his hands in his
    pockets, next to him du Maurier; then Heyermans, Bource, and
    all the other chums, and, though last not least, the proud
    bearer of the steaming punch-bowl. What a set of jolly good
    fellows! It is quite a pleasure to pore over the sketch and
    contemplate du Maurier's phiz, expressing his unbounded
    capacity of enjoyment. I can see him taking points that fell
    flat with the other fellows. Quite a pleasure, too, to think of
    Huysmans' big nose and Van Lerius' bald head, of the tall and
    the short, of spindle shanks and chubby face.</p>

    <p>Where are they all now? Some thirty-five years have elapsed,
    and the whirligig of time has
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>{68}</span> been revolving with unfailing
       regularity, dropping us here and there, as caprice dictated,
       some to stand, some to fall. What has become of the threads
       of friendship, picked up at the studio or the café, perhaps
       whilst puzzling over the chess-board, or when harmonising in
       four-part song? Golden threads; some destined to be spun out
       and to become solidly intertwined; others to be hopelessly
       entangled or cruelly snapped asunder by the inexorable
       Fates. Where shall I find them now, those friends and boon
       companions of my Bohemian days? Here, there, and
       everywhere&mdash;perhaps nowhere! Some I see trotting
       briskly along the high-road of life, others dragging wearily
       through its tangled bypaths. Yet again others resting under
       a big, cold stone that bears an inscription and a couple of
       dates, fixed just above their
       heads.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"

    <h2>II.</h2>

    <p>I well remember a certain "barrière" that protected the
    level crossing just outside the Malines Station. It was but an
    ordinary piece of hinged timber, but we, that is, du Maurier
    and I, can never forget it; for, as we stood by its side we
    vowed that come what might, we would never travel along that
    line and past the old gate without recalling that summer
    evening and re-thinking the thoughts of our early days.</p>

    <p>It was also there, one evening, that we adopted our
    never-to-be-forgotten aliases&mdash;Rag and Bobtail. We had
    chanced upon a chum of ours named Sprenk lounging across that
    old barrière, and some fortuitous circumstance having revealed
    the fact that his initials were T.A.G., we forthwith dubbed him
    Tag. Out of that very naturally grew the further development:
    Rag, Tag, and
    Bobtail.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>{70}</span> 

    <p>T.A.G. was an Englishman, strong and hearty and considerably
    taller than either of us. That alone would have sufficed to
    secure him the friendship of du Maurier, who ever worshipped at
    the shrine of physical greatness. He loved to look up to the
    man of six-foot-something, or to sit in the shadow of the woman
    of commanding presence, his appreciation of size culminating in
    the love of "Chang," that dog of dogs, whom we have all learnt
    to admire, as we followed his career through the volumes of the
    immortal Weekly, presided over by Toby and his master.</p>

    <p>I somehow associate Tag with whisky and water; not that he
    took it much or often, but he gave one the impression that
    whatever others might do when amongst the benighted foreigner,
    he, for one, would not let a good old English custom drop into
    disuse. Looking at Tag one intuitively felt that his father
    before him had taken his moderate glass of W. and W., and that,
    if he married and had sons, they would do likewise. I do not
    think that he was particularly fond of art or artists, unless
    inasmuch as they were brother Bohemians. He was engaged, or, at
    least, he was generally just about to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
       id="page71"></a>{71}</span> engaged, in some business, and
       whilst waiting for the opportune moment to commence
       operations, he would settle down to an expectant present.
       The golden opportunity he was looking for was plainly
       visible on his horizon, but it had a way of remaining
       stationary, and as it was contrary to Tag's nature to move
       unless under great pressure, the two never met.</p>

    <p>In the meanwhile Tag was one of our trio of chums; he was a
    good deal with us when we were out and about, bent on storming
    the world, or climbing Parnassus; we did the climbing, he the
    looking on, the parts thus being distributed to our mutual
    satisfaction. He was always pleasantly acquiescent, and had the
    rare gift of making himself useless agreeably; a common bond of
    interest we had in the Colorado claro and oscuro, whether the
    fair or dark, applied to the friendly weed or the still more
    friendly fair sex.</p>

    <p>He describes himself pretty correctly in a letter he wrote
    to us from Paris, when he says:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Since my arrival here my notes of what I have to do
        represent what I have not done, and if it be true that the
        infernal regions are paved
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
           id="page72"></a>{72}</span> with good intentions, I
           shall be received on my arrival by a deputation of souls
           to thank me for my contribution to the pavement."</p>

    <p>There are sketches in which Tag's eloquence is confined to
    one exclamation, "Matilda!" But whether that name was coupled
    with present felicity or future hopes I do not recollect. But
    du Maurier's lines describe him and our chumship
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"

    <p><i>Apropos</i> of plans and prospects on Tag's distant
    horizon, I find a passage in one of his letters, dated
    November, 1857, which is well worth recording. I quote it to
    give myself and my fellow Europeans an opportunity of rejoicing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>{74}</span> that Tag's scheme belonged to
       those that were not to be realised. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"As du Maurier's eye, though better, will, most
        probably, not allow him to resume his profession as a
        painter, we have determined to try our fortune together in
        Australia, and mean to start from here early in February.
        He hopes to obtain employment by drawing sketches,
        caricatures, &amp;c., for the Melbourne <i>Punch</i>, and
        other illustrated papers. You know how eminently suited he
        is for that kind of work, and we hear that an artist of
        talent of that description is much wanted out there, and
        would be sure to do exceedingly well. I, of course, do not
        intend to start in that line, but hope to be able to
        support myself for the first few years, after which I shall
        establish myself in business on my own account, and I
        trust, with luck, I may return home in the course of from
        ten to fifteen years, if not with immense riches, at all
        events with enough to enable me to pass the remainder of my
        'old age' in peace and comfort."</p>

    <p>Did Tag ever go, I wonder? Did he come back, and has he
    perhaps been enjoying his "old
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>{77}</span> age" somewhere over here for the
       last thirty years?&mdash;I wish you would say what
       <i>has</i> become of you, my dear Tag. I'm sure we should be
       chums again, if you're anything like the dear old
       stick-in-the-mud of former days! Don't you recollect that
       sketch of Rag's? I had nearly forgotten to mention it, the
       one with the three ropes of life. I am climbing ahead with
       fiendish energy. Rag follows, steadily ascending, weighted
       as he is with a treasure, a box marked "Mrs. Rag, with
       care," and your noble form is squatting on the floor, a
       glass of the best blend at your feet, and a cigar you are
       enjoying from which rises the legend that makes you say,
       "What the deuce am I to do with this confounded rope? Hang
       myself, I wonder?" Nonsense, to be sure; but do come and
       tell me what you <i>have</i> done with the rope, or say
       where I can find you still squatting.</p>

    <p>That music of a certain spontaneous kind, the music within
    us which we were ever longing to bring to the surface, was a
    bond of union between du Maurier and myself, I have already
    mentioned; but that bond was to be greatly strengthened by the
    music that great musicians on more than one occasion lavished
    on us. First came Louis <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>{78}</span> Brassin, the pianist. He had
       studied under Moscheles at the Conservatorio of Leipsic, the
       city of Bach and Mendelssohn fame; and there, from the days
       of his boyhood, he had belonged to the little circle of
       intimates who frequently gathered around the master at his
       house.</p>

    <p>When, a few years later, he came to Belgium on a concert
    tour, he and I found no difficulty in taking up the old
    friendship contracted in my father's house, just where we had
    left it. The boy had become the man, the student had developed
    into the artist and thorough musician. He was the boonest of
    boon companions, and his jokes were so broad that they often
    reminded one, in their crudeness and their rudeness, of certain
    passages in Mozart's early letters. To say that he spoke French
    with a German accent à la Svengali would be putting it very
    mildly; Teutonic gutturals would most unceremoniously invade
    the sister language; d's and t's, b's and p's would ever change
    places, as they are made to do in some parts of the Fatherland.
    With all that, he rejoiced in a delightful fluency of speech,
    conveying quaint and original thought. There was something
    decidedly interesting about Brassin's looks, but his figure
    gave one the impression of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>{80}</span> having been very carelessly put
       together; when he walked his head went back on his
       shoulders, and his hat went back on his head; his long arms
       dangled, pendulum-like, by his sides, while his lanky legs,
       dragging along anyhow, were ever lagging behind one another.
       But when he opened the piano and put hands and feet to keys
       and pedal, he was not the same individual. He would turn on
       nerve and muscle-power, and would hurl avalanches of music
       and torrents of notes at his audience till he, in his turn,
       was overwhelmed with thunders of applause. And those were
       the days, we must remember, when but few men could play at a
       greater rate than twenty to twenty-five miles an hour; when
       grand pianos were not yet ironclad and armour-plated, or had
       learnt proudly to display the maker's name on their
       broadside when they went forth to do battle on the concert
       field.</p>

    <p>Brassin used to draw inane caricatures of himself, which he
    would present to us with a triumphant laugh of immoderate
    calibre. I have preserved some of these, but decidedly prefer
    du Maurier's rendering of our common friend. In the
    accompanying drawing he shows him at the piano, entertaining us
    on "A rainy day."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>{82}</span> 

    <p>"Ah! Felix, amico mio," he says, "may thy room be always as
    jolly, thy coffee be ever so sweet, as on that happy morning!
    May Brassin's fingers be ever as brilliant and inspired! May
    Tag be ever as lazy, and with equal satisfaction to himself,
    and may I never be blinder! Amen."</p>

    <p>That sketch admirably pourtrays the lankiness and flabbiness
    of Brassin's figure, contrasting as it did with the strength of
    the wrist and the grip of the fingers. He was certainly a fine
    subject for du Maurier, whom I always looked upon as a sort of
    vivisector of music and musicians, of their methods and their
    moods. A brilliant career awaited Louis Brassin, but it was to
    be suddenly and unexpectedly cut off. He died some ten years
    ago at the age of forty-four.</p>

    <p>In 1858 my father came on a visit to Antwerp with my mother
    and my youngest sister, Clara. Wherever my father took up his
    abode, even temporarily, a grand piano would in the natural
    course of events gravitate towards him, and a select circle of
    art lovers would soon be grouped around it. Amongst the friends
    in the Antwerp circle were&mdash;Van Lerius, Tadema, Baron
    Leys, Heyermans, and Bource. My sister at that time was a
    bright and happy creature, not long
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>{83}</span> out of her teens, full of
       hopes&mdash;alas! never to be realised, and of talents never
       to be matured. The large dark eyes&mdash;they seemed the
       gift of her godmother, the famous Malibran&mdash;reflected
       the artist's soul, and a grand soprano voice spoke its
       powerful language. Du Maurier and she were
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>{84}</span> soon on a brother and sisterly
       footing, and they ever remained so.</p>

    <p>Of the pleasant evenings we of the circle spent together I
    recall one in particular. My sister had been singing one song
    after another; my father was engaged in an animated
    conversation with Stefani, the pianist, on the relative merits
    of Mendelssohn and Schumann. Du Maurier and I had been sitting
    at the farther end of the room, talking of his eyes. At that
    time one doctor held out hopes; another, a great authority, had
    considered it his painful duty not to conceal the truth from
    his patient, and had, with much unction and the necessary
    complement of professional phraseology, prepared him for the
    worst. The sight of one eye had gone, that of the other would
    follow. Those were anxious days, both for him and for his
    friends; but, whatever he felt, he could talk about his trouble
    with perfect equanimity, and I often wondered how quietly he
    took it, and how cheerfully he would tell me that he was
    "fearfully depressed." That evening I had been putting the
    chances of a speedy recovery before him, and making predictions
    based, I am bound to admit, on nothing more substantial than my
    ardent hopes. But du Maurier
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>{85}</span> was too much of a philosopher to
       be satisfied with such encouragement as I could give, and
       said: "No, I had better face the enemy and be prepared for
       the worst. If it comes, you see, my dear fellow, there is
       Nature's law of compensation, and I firmly believe that one
       cannot lose one faculty without being compensated by some
       great gain elsewhere. I suppose one gets to see more inside
       as things grow darker outside. If one can't paint, one must
       do something else&mdash;write perhaps; that is, as long as
       one can, and then, if the steam accumulates, and one wants a
       safety valve to let it off, dictate." Happily, to this day
       he writes, and need not have recourse to dictation.</p>

    <p>When we joined our friends we found Van Lerius and Heyermans
    had been pressed into the service, and were making sketches for
    my sister's album. Du Maurier took up a pencil, and, with a few
    characteristic touches, drew that sister's eyes. "Quand je les
    vois," he wrote underneath, "j'oublie les miens. (Reflexion
    d'un futur aveugle.) When I see them I forget my own.
    (Reflections of a man going blind.)"</p>

    <p>Soon the main business of the evening was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>{86}</span> resumed. Was it Beethoven's
       sonata for piano and violin, or a mighty improvisation on
       classical themes that came first? I do not recollect; but I
       remember that du Maurier's rendering of Balfe's "When other
       lips and other hearts," with my scratch accompaniment, was
       warmly greeted by all lips and hearts present.</p>

    <p>When these pleasant evenings had come to an end, the
    friendly intercourse was not allowed to drop, and so a number
    of sketches by her new friends found their way into Miss
    Clara's album.</p>

    <p>In the following winter, when I left on a short visit to
    Leipsic, he sent her a few lines through me. I quote from his
    letter because the wording is peculiar, and illustrates his
    capacity for expressing himself in a language that he had to
    evolve from his inner consciousness:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Herr Rag schickt zu Fräulein Moscheles <i>sein</i>
    empfehlung und <i>ihren</i> bruder; es wird höflicht gebeten
    das sie wird die sach reciprokiren, und in fünftzen dägen
    <i>ihr</i> empfehlung und <i>seinen</i> freund zuruck
    schicken."</p>

    <p>For the benefit of those whose inner consciousness is not in
    touch with the above, I give the English version:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Mr. Rag sends <i>his</i> greeting and <i>her</i> brother
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>{87}</span> to Miss Moscheles, and kindly
       requests her to reciprocate the proceeding in a fortnight by
       returning <i>her</i> greeting and <i>his</i> friend."</p>

    </div>

    <p>When I think how easily and spontaneously such sketches
    dropped from his pen, I am reminded of a passage in one of
    Mendelssohn's letters to my mother; he sends her the
    <i>Mailied</i> and says: "This morning a song came to me. I
    really must write it down for you." So, too, from the first the
    pen-and-ink compositions came to du Maurier. His talent
    manifested itself not only in a desire to illustrate this or
    that incident or adventure, but also in his inexhaustible
    capacity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>{88}</span> for making something out of
       nothing, and as the nothing was never lacking, he might well
       say: "Dear Bobtail, I will never write without sending my
       compliments to thine album." His rendering of "Cher Lix,"
       for instance, takes the shape of a graceful monogram, or
       diplogram, or whatever I ought to call a combination of our
       two profiles and my name.</p>

       you out of sheer idleness, so as to have an excuse not to
       pack up for the next half-hour." Or he draws himself looking
       over my shoulder whilst I am writing to my sister and puts

    <p>Another time he wants me to send him some brushes and
    various other painting materials he enumerates: "Oh, and a
    little thing like this for oil to do the thing cheesy." He
    depicts himself quite elated; his eyes seemed so much better
    that he had once more resumed work in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>{91}</span> studio of his friend Goyers.
       "Gruss from maternal and self," he ends; "ganz hertzlich;

    <p>Monsieur Staps, Sous-Chef of the "Guides," the best military
    band in Brussels, was a friend of ours. He had invited us to
    one of the famous Concerts du Conservatoire, a treat in
    anticipation of which du Maurier at once takes to the pen, and
    shows us in classical garments and dignified attitudes
    listening to the "young men of the Conservatorio." "Sketch
    represents," he says <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>{92}</span> "Claudius Felix et Publius
       Busso, cum centurione Guidorum, audientes juvenes

       full name&mdash;George Louis Palmella Busson du Maurier.</p>

    <p>In striking contrast with the last drawing is the next. Here
    we are decidedly anything but conventional in our attire, as he
    depicts us in "Double-bedded room, Brussels. Time 11 a.m.
    (train starts 11.20). Bobtail's face being rather smutty, he
    washes it, and Rag's boots being rather tight, he puts them on
    at leisure, during which process he has time to smoke three
    pipes. <i>Bobtail</i>. Bub-bub-bub-bub ... whew ... pouf!...

    <p>A favourite theme of his was his supposed inability to shine
    on occasions when I had introduced him to friends of mine, and
    was particularly anxious to show him off to advantage, and
    then, again, the unrelenting fate that would swiftly overtake
    him if he ventured to put himself forward. I need not say that
    the inability and the discomfiture existed only in his
    imagination, for in all circles he was ever appreciated and
    admired. But he would have it otherwise,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"

    <p>Du Maurier's stay in Blankenberghe was but short. He soon
    went to Düsseldorf to put himself under the treatment of a
    famous oculist, Hofrath de Leeuwe, who resided not far from
    there at Gräfrath. He wrote, in high spirits: "Spent yesterday
    in Gräfrath; jolly place, lots of beauties, plenty of singing
    and sketching and that sort of thing, you know. Long walks in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
       id="page98"></a>{98}</span> beautiful valleys, most
       delightful. The fact is, I'm so beastly merry since I've
       been here that I don't think I'm quite sane, and altogether
       only want your periodical visits and permission to have my
       fling on Saturday nights to be in heaven. Doctor says he'll
       do me good; have to go to Gräfrath once a week. Ça me bote

    <p>He had met some old acquaintances and fraternised with some
    English and American artists, had got into the swim of Gräfrath
    society, such as it was, and was soon placed on a pedestal,
    whilst sundry beauties sat at his feet and, to the best of my
    belief, sighed. "They all want me to make etchings of the
    little can-cans and lick-spittlings going on here. Splendid
    study; shall <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"

       the scene and says, in discreet whisper and with much

    <p>I was moving, and as du Maurier kept on being about to go to
    Antwerp, I went to pay him a flying visit at Düsseldorf on my
    way to Paris. We sat into the small hours of the morning (as he
    depicts us), talking of the past, present, and future, a
    long-necked Rhine-wine bottle and two green glasses beside us,
    our hopes and aspirations rising with the cloud that curled
    from my ever-glowing cigar. We talked till his fertile
    imagination took us across the sea, and "Ragmar of the
    Maurialva and Bobthailva, the son of Moscheles, swore eternal
    amity on their native heath."</p>

    <p>Damask was another beauty whom we appreciated, perhaps all
    the more because we knew she was dying of consumption.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In Paris I was probably absorbed in some work I had in hand
    and must have neglected du Maurier, for he writes urging me to
    answer by return of post and give an account of myself. He had
    been visited, he says, by an alarming nightmare, which he
    forthwith sketches for my benefit. Carry, the Circe, had
    captured the lion. The noble beast&mdash;that was me&mdash;had
    succumbed to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"

    <p>Another time when, I suppose, I was again letting him wait
    for an answer, he writes from Düsseldorf: "DEAR
    BOBTAIL,&mdash;Est-ce que tu te donnes le genre de m'oublier
    par hazard? I <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
       id="page109"></a>{109}</span> have been expecting a letter
       from you every day, running thus: 'DEAR RAG,&mdash;Come to
       Paris <i>immediately</i>, to illustrate thirty-six
       periodical papers which I have got for you. In haste,
       Bobtail.' My old pal, Tom Armstrong, is here, working hard;
       eyes the same as ever. Write soon and tell all about that
       portrait. Düsseldorf rencontre was jolly." The letter is
       headed by a drawing representing me soaring heavenwards,
       whilst he, chained to the spot, is philosophically
       consulting the cards on his prospects of release.</p>

    thing."</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

    <p>I suppose I answered saying that I only put off writing till
    I had mustered the full complement of periodicals. If I was in
    a prophetic mood I may have added that it was all right, and
    that very shortly thirty-six editors would be clamouring for
    his work, and perhaps thirty-six States hallooing for him to
    come over <i>immediately</i>.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
       id="page111"></a>{111}</span> Hoping to be punch'd at an
       early date, I probably remained his, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

    <p>The early date came, for, before his final return to
    England, we met once more in Antwerp and Malines. And that
    takes me back to Carry. She was changed to her advantage, so,
    at least, the world of Malines thought. We were not quite so
    sure that the change would prove altogether to her advantage.
    She had been quite pretty enough before, and we thought she
    could well have done without developing further physical
    attractions. She had always known how to use her eyes, not
    unfrequently shedding their beneficent light on two persons at
    the same time, and we considered that that number should not be
    exceeded. But now their activity seemed daily increasing, and
    it was not without concern that we noticed in her a certain
    restlessness and a growing tendency to discuss with the serpent
    questions relating to the acquisition of prohibited apples.
    After a while, and perhaps in consequence of the good advice we
    gave her, she sobered down and surprised us by her docility;
    but at best her moods were uncertain and she puzzled us
    much.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>{112}</span> 

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/109.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/109.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Now, Bobtail," said Rag, as we walked along the sober old
    streets of Malines, discussing the state of Carry's mind and
    heart. (He has omitted the streets, but has put us into our
    very best mediæval suit.) "Now, Bobtail, what do
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>{113}</span> you think? Is she in love? And
       if so, with whom?"</p>

    <p>"She may be, or she may be not," said Bobtail, with oracular
    discretion; "but, if she is, it can only be with one of us. She
    would not waste her sentiment on a native whilst we were within
    reach."</p>

    <p>"But which of us is it?" asked Rag, somewhat alarmed.</p>

    <p>"I know not; but I hope neither," answered the oracle thus
    appealed to; "but the state of her mind, I believe, is this: If
    she were to marry you, she would fall in love with me; and if
    she were to marry me, she would fall in love with you."</p>

    <p>This dictum must have impressed du Maurier, for it started
    him on a series of drawings, with accompanying text in
    illustration of it. There were to be two volumes. The first, in
    which I figure as the husband, was rapidly produced; the
    second, in which he was to be the husband, never saw the light
    of day. It was shelved <i>sine die</i>, a proceeding I always
    thought particularly unfair, as he never gave <i>me</i> a
    chance of being loved. I am compensated, however, by the
    possession of the first volume of the "Noces de Picciola," or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
       id="page114"></a>{114}</span> "Cari-catures," as they are
       called. On the title-page Bobtail is made to say:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Varium et mutabile semper femina," he adds, and his story
    illustrates the truth of the poet's words. His points will be
    so much better understood later on, when some of the problems
    connected with our matrimonial laws have been solved, that it
    would be a pity to publish them prematurely. Suffice it to show
    how Félix and Georges produced the portrait of Picciola. "Félix
    put all his talent and Georges all his good will into it, for,
    once completed, Picciola was to select a husband from the two
    suitors. After much cogitation she decides for Félix, whilst
    offering her friendship to Georges, who seems
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>{115}</span> but moderately satisfied with
       this arrangement; and then, when husband and wife leave for
       distant countries, Georges, who cannot bear the thought of
       being parted from his dear Picciola, enters the service of
       the young couple and accompanies them on their honeymoon."
       This mythical journey gives the author opportunities for the
       subtle psychological analysis of a young lady's heart,
       strongly inclined to revolt against some of the conventions
       laid down by Society for its regulation.</p>

    <p>But it was not to be. A big wave intervened to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
       id="page117"></a>{117}</span> separate us, and swept away
       all traces of the road before us. Poor Carry! Yes, she had a
       story. Sad. Bright. Then sad again. First she gave to Amor
       what was Amor's, and then to Hymen what was Hymen's. She
       tasted of the apple her friend the serpent had told her so
       much about. Then&mdash;"la femme à une chute est rare comme
       le Niagara"&mdash;and there are more apples than one in the
       Garden of Eden&mdash;she tried another; such a bad one
       unfortunately. It was a wonder it didn't poison her, body
       and soul, but it didn't. There was a moment when the Angel
       with the flaming sword threatened to cast her adrift, and it
       would have fared badly with her had not a helping hand come
       to save her. But sound as she was at the core, and true, she
       rallied and rose again to new life and unhoped-for
       happiness. It was a young doctor who came to the rescue; a
       mere boy he seemed to look at; but a man he was in deed and
       word. He worked hard and walked fast; he defied convention
       and challenged fate. With a stout heart he laboured to raise
       Carry to the level of his affections, and with a strong hand
       he tightened his hold upon her. He loved her passionately,
       devotedly, and she, clinging to him as to the instrument of
       her <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>{118}</span> salvation, gradually regained
       her better self, and, slowly but surely, learnt to find in
       her own heart the greatest of treasures that woman can
       bestow upon man. But he was a Southerner of the French
       meridional type, excitable and impulsive, and, so, alas! he
       was jealous of Carry's northern friends and snapped the
       thread asunder that bound her to them. We only knew, and
       that we learnt in a roundabout way, that she was the
       happiest little wife in Paris. Once, and only once, she
       wrote to us, to tell us how complete was her happiness. A
       crowning glory had come; a little glory to nurse and fondle,
       to cry over&mdash;tears of joy; to smile to&mdash;the
       prettiest, foolishest of mother's smiles; to pray for and to
       worship from the bottom of her little blossoming soul. It
       was not till three years later that I was in Paris and
       succeeded in picking up the thread of Carry's story. Hale
       and hearty, overflowing with health and happiness, the young
       doctor had gone to his work at the hospital. He came home
       blood-poisoned, to die in his wife's arms. It was a case of
       self-sacrifice in the cause of science, of heroic devotion
       to a fellow-creature. And the young widow was left alone
       again, with none to weep over (tears of anguish this time)
       but the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>{119}</span> little glory, who, poor thing,
       could only wonder, but not soothe. What can have become of
       Carry once more cast adrift in Paris to fight the battle of
       life in this hard ever love-making world?</p>

    <p>We never knew.</p>

    <p>What with the boxing-gloves and one thing and another, he
    had been "getting English again by degrees." In a drawing he
    shows us how he is going through the process arm-in-arm with
    his old friend, Tom Armstrong, now the Art-Director of that
    very English institution, the South Kensington Museum.
    Armstrong and T.R. Lamont, the man who to this day bears such a
    striking resemblance to our friend the Laird,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>{120}</span> had presented du Maurier with
       a complete edition of Edgar Allan Poe's works. His
       appreciation of that author is expressed in a letter which
       he addressed to Armstrong, and it needs not much reading
       between the lines to gather what was the literary diet best
       suited to his taste. It is amusing, too, to notice the
       little shadows cast here and there by coming events.</p>

    <p>Du Maurier's stay on the Continent had come to a close some
    time before mine, and to that circumstance I owe several
    letters in which he speaks of his first experiences in London.
    He revelled in the metamorphosis he was going
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>{123}</span> through, and illustrated the
       past and the present for my better comprehension. There on
       one side of the Channel he shows the dejected old lion of
       Malines gnawing his tobaccoless clay pipe, and then on the
       other the noble beast stalking along jauntily with tail
       erect and havannah alight. He wrote in high
       spirits:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"DEAR BOBTAIL,&mdash;I need not tell you how very jolly
        it was to get your letter and to hear good news of you. My
        reason for not writing was that I intended to make my
        position before giving of my news to anybody. I was just
        funky and blue about it at first, but fortunately I was
        twigged almost immediately, and, barring my blessed
        idleness, am getting on splendaciously just now. Lots of my
        things have been out. I'm going in for becoming a
        swell.</p>

        <p>"How strange to think of such a change. I'm
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
           id="page124"></a>{124}</span> leading the merriest of
           lives, and only hope it will last. Living with Henley,
           No. 85, Newman Street; very jolly and comfortable.
           Chumming with all the old Paris fellows again, all of
           them going ahead. There's Whistler is already one of the
           great celebrities here&mdash;Poynter getting on. This is
           a very jolly little village, and I wish you were over
           here. They do make such a fuss with an agreeable fellow
           like you or me, for instance. But I suppose Paris is
           just as jolly in its way. My ideas of Paris are all
           Bohème, quartier latin, &amp;c., et si c'était à
           recommencer, ma foi je crois que je dirais 'zut.' This
           is a hurried and absurd letter to write to an old pal
           like you, but I hardly ever have time for a
           line&mdash;out late every night and make use of what
           little daylight there is in Newman Street to draw. 'S'il
           faisait au moins clair de Lune pendant le jour dans ce
           sacré pays.' I daresay I shall treat myself to a trip
           over to Paris as soon as the weather is jollier. I
           intend to go abroad this summer to do some etchings 'qui
           seront aux pommes.' Is there any chance whatever of your
           coming over here before? You mustn't form your opinion
           of my performances by what you may happen to see, as
           half of what I do is spoiled by bad engraving (that's
           why I intend <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
           id="page125"></a>{125}</span> to etch), and what I have
           done, bar one or two things, are merely little chic
           sketches for money. I have many plans; among others I
           intend to bring out a series in <i>Punch</i>, with which
           I shall take peculiar care&mdash;something quite
           original. I think you would precious soon get more
           portraits than you could paint here, but if you are
           getting on so well in Paris, of course it would be
           madness to leave. But I do not like the idea of your not
           being one of us&mdash;such a band of brothers full of
           jolly faults that dovetail beautifully. It was quite a
           freak of mine coming over here; I did it against
           everybody's advice&mdash;came over with a ten-pound note
           and made the rest. 'Your friend Bobtail seems to be the
           only man who had no doubt of your talent,' writes my
           mother. 'Enfin c'est prouvé que je suis au moins bon a
           quelque chose.' Do you go much into the world? I go
           knocking about as happily as possible, singing and
           smoking cigars everywhere. Jimmy Whistler and I go
           'tumbling' together, as Thackeray says. Would you were
           here to tumble with us! Enfin, mon bon, écris moi
           vite."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When at last I too returned to London I was privileged to
    take my humble share in the "tumbling," as also in the steady
    process that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
       id="page126"></a>{126}</span> was gradually to wean us from
       Bohemia. We tumbled pretty regularly into the Pamphilon, a
       restaurant within a stone's throw of Oxford Circus, of the
       familiar type that exhibits outside its door a bill of fare
       with prices appended, to be studied by those who count their
       shillings and pence as we did. We had got beyond the days
       when no wines are sour and when tough meat passes muster, if
       there is only plenty of it; we wanted a sound dinner, and we
       got it at the Pamphilon; to wind up we adjourned to the
       coffee-room and talked and read and smoked.</p>

    <p>Stacey Marks, Poynter, Jimmy Whistler, and Charles Keene
    were among the crew, and others not so well known to fame.
    Pleasant hours those and gemüthliche, as the Germans say; how
    different the after-dinner clay pipe or cheap weed of those
    times to the post-prandial havannah we now complacently whiff
    at our friend's Mæcenas' hospitable table! Yes, things have
    changed, my dear Rag, since the day we were paying our bill,
    and you addressed the waiter with superb affability: "Here,
    Charles, is a penny for you. I know it isn't much, but I can't
    afford more."</p>

    <p>It is hard to fancy anything less like Bohemia than Regent
    Street, but a little incident that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>{127}</span> occurred as I walked down that
       busy thoroughfare one afternoon recalls the best traditions
       of the land in which practical jokes abound. I was going
       along without any definite aim, killing time and gathering
       wool, flanéing, in fact; perhaps there was a touch of the
       foreigner about me, for I had only lately returned from
       abroad; anyway I suddenly found myself singled out as a fit
       subject to be victimised. I felt a hand stealthily sliding
       into my pocket; on the spur of the moment I grasped that
       hand in as much of an iron grip as I could muster.
       Then&mdash;I hardly know why&mdash;I waited quite a number
       of seconds before I turned round. When I did, it was du
       Maurier's face that I beheld, blanched with terror. Those
       seconds had been ages to him. Good heavens! had he made a
       mistake? Was it not Bobtail's but another man's hand that
       was clutching his wrist? Thank Heaven, it was Bobtail's!</p>

    <p>There never was an occasion, before or after, I feel
    absolutely sure, when du Maurier was more truly glad to see me.
    His colour rapidly returned, and he swore that of all the
    bonnes blagues this was the best; but for all that, one thing
    is certain&mdash;he has never since attempted to pick pockets
    in Regent Street.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"
       id="page128"></a>{128}</span> 

    <p>A delightful compromise between Bohemia and the land where
    well-regulated Society rules supreme, was the ground on which
    stood Moray Lodge, the residence of Arthur Lewis, the head of
    the well-known firm of Lewis and Allenby.</p>

    <p>We have read of him before:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Sir Lewis Cornelys, as everybody knows, lives in a
        palace on Campden Hill, a house of many windows, and,
        whichever window he looks out of, he sees his own garden
        and very little else. There was no pleasanter or more
        festive house than his in London, winter or summer."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I quote this, as probably it may not be known to everybody
    that Sir Lewis was knighted on the memorable occasion of
    Trilby's birthday, when she was presented at the
    drawing&mdash;and every other&mdash;room. With much kindly
    fore-thought his friend and biographer allows him to be eighty
    years old in the early sixties, thereby enabling him to have
    attained to-day the ripe old age of one hundred and
    fourteen.</p>

    <p>Well, he was one of du Maurier's earliest friends, and when
    Taffy the Laird, and Little Billie, "a-smokin' their pipes and
    cigyars," told the cabby to drive to Mechelen Lodge, I found my
    way to what I called Moray Lodge, and met
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
       id="page129"></a>{129}</span> them there. And there too, to
       be sure, was Glorioli, "the tall, good-looking swarthy
       foreigner from whose scarcely parted, moist, thick, bearded
       lips issued the most ravishing sounds that had ever been
       heard from throat of man or woman or boy."</p>

    <p>As we now empty one or the other of the million bottles that
    are about, marked "De Soria, Bordeaux," we often think with
    gratitude of the great wine-grower and still greater singer, so
    correctly described as "singing best for love or glory in the
    studios of his friends."</p>

    <p>To return to Arthur Lewis:&mdash;</p>

    <p>He occupied an exceptional position, inasmuch as he had made
    his house a centre towards which intellectual London
    gravitated. When he had done this, that, and the other to make
    his bachelor days memorable to a host of friends, he wound up
    by marrying one of England's fairest women, our great actress,
    Kate Terry. It was in those early days that Ellen, the
    débutante, was introduced to the dramatic world as "Kate
    Terry's sister." Since then Kate, having elected to rest on her
    laurels, is proud to be referred to by the younger generation
    as "Ellen Terry's
    sister."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
       id="page130"></a>{130}</span> 

    <p>In early life Lewis had various roads open to him. Born, as
    he was, with the capacity of a man of business, the means and
    opportunities of a man of leisure, and the talents of an
    artist, he managed to follow the three roads at the same time,
    and they all led to well-deserved success. He was to be found
    at his desk in Regent Street, at his easel in the studio, or on
    the threshold of that big billiard and reception room which he
    had built to entertain his friends. Himself an artist, and for
    many years a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, he was on
    terms of close friendship with the men who had made their mark
    in the art-world, and with many who were destined to become
    famous. He was a Mæcenas of the right sort, knowing a good
    thing when he came across it, and frequently acquiring it
    before the sleepy world awoke to its merits.</p>

    <p>I well recollect the enthusiasm with which he welcomed the
    first pictures Joseph Israels exhibited in England in 1862.
    Neither in the English nor in the Dutch department of the
    Exhibition could he ascertain whether these two pictures, "The
    Drowned Fisherman" and "Washing the Cradle," were for sale. But
    luck would have it that he was introduced to Israels
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
       id="page131"></a>{131}</span> at the Academy <i>soirée</i>,
       and the artist, assuring him that the pictures were
       "certainly for sale," Lewis secured the coveted works, and
       was thus the first to establish Israels' fame in
       England.</p>

    <p>The gatherings in Moray Lodge were unique in their way. It
    was characteristic of the master and the house that they made
    everybody feel at home, from the titled aristocrat in the
    dress-suit to the free-and-easy brother-brush or pen, and the
    sometimes out-at-elbow friend Bohemian.</p>

    <p>There was the Duke of Sutherland, the Marquis of Lorne, Lord
    Dufferin, Mr. Frederic Leighton, Associate of the Royal
    Academy, Fred Walker, who sang tenor in the choir, of which
    more presently, and who on several occasions designed the cards
    of invitation for Lewis. There was Lord Houghton, Charles
    Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Rossetti, Landseer, Daubigny, Gustave
    Doré, Arthur Sullivan, Leech, Keene, Tenniel, &amp;c., &amp;c.
    It is as hard to pass those names over without comment as it
    must have been to run the gauntlet of Scylla and Charybdis, for
    every one of them brings back some recollection, and calls upon
    the pen to start a paragraph with an "I well remember."</p>

    <p>But that would lead me away from Moray
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>{132}</span> Lodge and the famous Saturday
       evenings, and I never was, and am not now, in a hurry to get
       away from that hospitable mansion.</p>

    <p>The billiard-table was boxed over on the gala nights and
    transformed into a buffet. It was covered with bottles and
    glasses, pipes and cigars, and towards the close of the evening
    with mountains of oysters. The amount we consumed on one
    occasion was 278 dozen, as I happen to know. But the great
    attraction at these gatherings was the part-singing of the
    twenty-five "Moray Minstrels." John Foster was the conductor,
    and led them to such perfection that the severest critic of the
    day, dear old crabbed Henry F. Chorley, proclaimed them the
    best representatives of the English school of glee-singing.</p>

    <p>Another no less interesting feature was the performance of
    small theatrical pieces. Du Maurier and Harold Power had given
    us charming musical duologues, like "Les Deux Aveugles," by
    Offenbach, and "Les Deux Gilles," with great success, and that
    led to further developments and far-reaching consequences. A
    small party of friends were dining with Lewis. "What shall we
    get up next?" was the question
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"
       id="page133"></a>{133}</span> raised. "Something new and
       original," suggested the host. "Now, Sullivan, you should
       write us something." "All right," said Sullivan, "but how
       about the words? Where's the libretto?" "Oh, I'll write
       that," said Burnand. And thus those two were started. "Cox
       and Box," a travesty of "Box and Cox," was read and
       rehearsed a fortnight afterwards at Burnand's house, and the
       following Saturday it was performed at Moray Lodge. Du
       Maurier was "Box," Harold Power "Cox," and John Foster
       "Sergeant Bouncer." Du Maurier's rendering of "Hush-a-by,
       Bacon," was so sympathetic and tender that one's heart went
       out to the contents of the frying-pan, wishing them pleasant
       dreams.</p>

    <p>Then there was his famous duet with "Box," reciting their
    marriage to one and the same lady, and the long recitative in
    which the printer describes his elaborate preparations for
    suicide.</p>

    <p>How he solemnly walked to the cliff and heard the seagulls'
    mournful cry&mdash;and looked all around&mdash;there was nobody
    nigh. Then (disposing his bundle on the brink)&mdash;"Away to
    the opposite side I walked." ("Away" on the high A, that
    Sullivan put in on purpose for du
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"
       id="page134"></a>{134}</span> Maurier, who possessed that
       chest-note in great fulness.)</p>

    <p>I must skip a few years and speak of a drawing that appeared
    in <i>Punch</i> in 1875,<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
       and which has a special interest for me; it brings back to
       my mind a happy thought of du Maurier's, which is closely
       connected with a particularly happy thought of my own, that
       took root then and has flourished ever since.</p>

    <p>I must explain that there was a time when I had to console
    myself with the reflection that the course of true love never
    runs smooth. A lady whom in my mind I had selected as a
    mother-in-law, by no means reciprocated my feelings of respect
    and goodwill. But the young lady, her daughter, fortunately
    sided with me, and had, in fact, given her very willing consent
    to the change in her mother's position which I had suggested. I
    was naturally anxious to assure that young lady as frequently
    and as emphatically as possible how much I appreciated her
    assistance, and how determined I was never to have any other
    mother-in-law but the one of my choice; nor could there be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
       id="page135"></a>{135}</span> anything obscure in such a
       declaration, as of three sisters in the family that
       particular one was the only unmarried one. But neither in
       obscure nor in explicit language was I allowed to approach
       her; a blockade was declared and rigorously enforced, and we
       were soon separated by a distance of some few hundred
       miles.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/132.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/132.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
       id="page137"></a>{137}</span> 

    <p>I can look back complacently on the troubles of those days
    now that twenty years have elapsed since I emerged victorious
    from the contest; but then the future looked blank and bleak,
    and I felt nonplussed and down-hearted. Knowing, however, what
    a faint heart is said never to win, I was anxious to keep mine
    up to the mark, and with a view to stimulating its buoyancy I
    went to make a friendly call on du Maurier. He would, I felt
    sure, be sympathetic, and, whatever else might be wanting in
    that troublesome eye of his, there would be a certain vivifying
    twinkle in it that could always set me up.</p>

    <p>It was as I expected, and I had the full benefit of the eye,
    and of an ear, too, that he lent willingly as I told him how
    matters stood.</p>

    <p>"Well," he said, "if you can't smuggle in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"
       id="page138"></a>{138}</span> letter, let's smuggle in your
       portrait. It will be rather a joke if she comes across you
       in <i>Punch</i>. I've just got a subject in which I can use
       you."</p>

    <p>To be sure, I jumped at the idea, only beseeching him to
    make me as handsome as he possibly could, without losing sight
    of the main object, viz., that the young lady should be able to
    recognise me. Her mother too, I felt sure, would not fail to be
    duly impressed, for to figure in <i>Punch</i> would raise me in
    her estimation as a person of no small importance.</p>

    <p>The drawing was made and published, and the scheme worked
    well; coupled, perhaps, with a few millions of other
    influences, and with the assistance of the Fates, it achieved
    the desired result, and before a year had elapsed the original
    drawing could be presented by du Maurier to the young lady, now
    become a bride, as a memento of bygone troubles.</p>

    <p>One more digression suggested by the name of Arthur
    Sullivan; it shall be the last. I am not going back to the time
    when we were boys together in Leipsic, but will only mention
    him in connection with Carry; this time Carry in another
    form.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"
       id="page139"></a>{139}</span> 

    <div class="figcenter"

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"
       id="page141"></a>{141}</span> 

    <p>Shortly after that big wave intervened that separated her
    from us a happy chance put me in possession of a dog, the most
    affectionate and lovable of Skye terriers.</p>

    <p>I named him Carry.</p>

    <p>That dog, his qualities and virtues, and especially his
    musical gifts, deserve more than a passing mention; but,
    trusting that he, like every dog, will have his day, I will
    here only transcribe a letter of his that he wrote with the
    assistance of his friend, Arthur Sullivan, who, attracted
    perhaps by the gifts above named, had kindly taken charge of
    him during my temporary absence on the Continent. Poor dog! He
    is dead now; so that there can be no indiscretion in publishing
    his bark and its translation. The former is best given in its
    original setting. The latter, purporting to be a "Translation
    of the foregoing by A.S.," runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"MY DEAR AND ESTEEMED MASTER,&mdash;My kind friend, Mr.
        Sullivan, who pretends to be as fond of me as you are, has
        taken me away from the enjoyment of a delicious mutton
        bone, in order to answer your letter; and as I cannot find
        a pen to suit me well, he is writing whilst I dictate.
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
           id="page142"></a>{142}</span> I was very low-spirited
           the other day after leaving you, and appeared to feel
           the parting very much, but it soon wore off under the
           influence of biscuit, bones, and kindness; indeed, I
           must do Sully and his family the justice to say that
           they try to do the utmost to make me happy and
           comfortable, although they don't always succeed, for
           sometimes I appear dissatisfied (hoping,
           <i>entre-nous</i>, by that means to get more out of
           them).</p>

        <p>"I have several idiosyncrasies and failings, of which my
        master (<i>pro tem.</i>) is trying to correct me, but finds
        it rather hard work, for I am not so easily brought out of
        them. I have a will of my own, but Sully says: 'Train up a
        dog in the way it should go, and he will not depart,
        &amp;c., &amp;c.'&mdash;and Sully is right.</p>

        <p>"Don't you think it is a bad plan to wash me with soap?
        I think it deters me from licking my skin, and consequently
        from having those ideas of cleanliness engendered within me
        which are so necessary to every well-bred dog moving in
        good society!</p>

        <p>"I want to get back to my bone, but Sully says I must
        first deliver a message from him. You are to give his love
        to your dear parents
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
           id="page143"></a>{143}</span> (in which I heartily
           join), and tell them how grieved he was that he did not
           see them to wish them 'God speed' before they left
           England, and how it hurt him to think that a long, long
           time would perhaps elapse before he should see them
           again.</p>

        <p>"And now, my dear master, I must say 'Good-bye.' Much
        love in few words, in which Sully joins me.</p>

        <p>"Believe me, ever your</p>

        <p>"Attached and faithful
        dog,</p><a href="images/140.png"><img class="inline"
             src="images/140.png"
             width="50%"
             alt="Carry X his mark" /></a> 

        <p>"F. MOSCHELES, Esq."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And now I come to du Maurier's last letter&mdash;the best,
    as I am sure every right-minded person will admit. I have kept
    it "pour la bonne bouche" (excuse my quoting French. "Will me
    not of it," as our neighbours say; there are unassailable
    precedents for such quoting, you know&mdash;or ought to know).
    The letter in question speaks of an event so momentous, that of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
       id="page144"></a>{144}</span> all events it is the one most
       worthy to "be marked with a white, white stone"; and marked
       it was, if not with a stone, with satins and laces and a
       veil and white orange blossoms.</p>

    <p>"Come and be introduced to the future Mrs. Kicky," it said.
    "She intends to celebrate her 21st birthday by a small dance.
    There will be friends and pretty girls, 'en veux tu, en violà.'
    So rek-lect, olf'lah, Tuesday, at half-past seven."</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:90%;">
        <a href="images/141.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/141.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The drawing shows how I was introduced, and how graciously I
    was received.</p>

    <p>The letter needs a word of explanation, as it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"
       id="page145"></a>{145}</span> speaks of the "future Mrs.
       'Kicky,'" and I have not yet mentioned that Kicky was but
       another name for du Maurier. He got it at an early period of
       his life. Just as any other baby less favoured by "Dame
       Fortune the witch" would have done, he gave himself his
       nickname. He picked it up in Brussels when he was two years
       old, and under the care of Flemish servants. They called him
       "Mannekin" (little man), and that he converted into "Kicky."
       I append one of the numerous varieties of his signature.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/142.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/142.png"
             alt="Kick" /></a>
    </div>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Rag, Tag, and Bobtail had its day, and was shelved soon
    after we bid adieu to Bohemia; but the Kicky survived and
    flourished, and to-day not only his old chums, but those
    nearest and dearest to him, feel that they could not do without
    that particular appellation, associated as it is with a
    thousand and one happy
    memories.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"
       id="page146"></a>{146}</span> 

    <p>And having arrived at that busiest of stations, the
    Matrimonial Junction, where the converted bachelor alights and
    changes for Better or for Worse, this chapter fitly comes to a
    close, meant as it was only to sketch some of the pleasant
    recollections that I, in common with so many of his friends,
    have of du Maurier's bachelor days.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
